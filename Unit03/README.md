# Jumper
This is the ultimate guessing game! Hangman, but with a twist. Think you can keep your parachuter alive? Let's see for how long.
A word will be randomly selected and it's up to you to see if you can guess it right, letter by letter. 
But a warning: The more guesses you get wrong, the closer your parachuter is to falling. Your parachute will
begin to break with every incorrect guess.
