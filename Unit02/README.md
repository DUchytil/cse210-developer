This is the ultimate card guessing game! The game will provide you with a card number.
Then it's up to you to guess if the next card will have a higher or lower value. 
Guess right and you get 100 points. Guess wrong, and you lose 75. The game starts
you out with 300. Lose all those points and you are out!
